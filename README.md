# Final Project Repo

Final Project Repository for [Matthew Halso](https://github.com/mchalso), [Romeo Stoll](https://github.com/rstol), and [Ram√≥n Calvo Gonzalez](https://github.com/noctrog) for "Solving partial differential equations in parallel on GPUs" course (ETH Zurich, Fall 2021).

## Part 1
[**Part 1**](/docs/part1.md): 3D multi-XPUs diffusion solver

Steady state solution of a diffusive process for given physical time steps using the pseudo-transient acceleration (using the so-called "dual-time" method). 

## Part 2
[**Part 2**](/docs/part2.md): 2D (and 1D) multi-XPUs shallow water equations solver

Shallow water equations solution for an instantaneous dam break applying the Lax-Friedrichs method for stabilization of fluxes.
